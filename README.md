# Pexus Bay
A simple hub for searching and downloading free stock images from popular sites.

The purpose of this project was to learn how to create an app using React. The choice was made to use hooks in creating components instead 
of the traditional classes. One of the main challenges in creating this app was to ensure proper display and downlaod of images. Proper 
images need to be loaded based on the source the user has chosen. If the user chooses to download an image, correct quality needs to
be downloaded per the users choice. Another major challenge was to allow the user to downlaod a single zip file of all the images he/she has
selected.

## Usage
[Live Demo](http://pexusbay.herokuapp.com/)

Pick a source by clicking on 'SOURCE' on the navigation bar.  Type in the term you would to search for and the page will be populated
with relevant imanges from the chosen source. Each image has a 'more' icon that will allow you to download the image or send it to the
'selected' page.  If you have images selected you will be able to download a zip file with all the images by navigating to the 'selected'
page from from the navigation bar.
